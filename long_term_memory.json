ViTAL: Vision-Based Terrain-Aware Locomotion for Legged Robots. <i>arXiv</i>.</div>\n<div class='paper-section'><b>SUMMARY:</b> This paper introduces ViTAL (Vision-Based Terrain-Aware Locomotion), a novel planning strategy for legged robots designed to overcome limitations of traditional locomotion planning. Unlike existing methods that optimize robot body pose relative to pre-selected footholds (which can lead to unreachable states if footholds are missed), ViTAL proposes a new pose adaptation paradigm. This paradigm focuses on optimizing the body pose to maximize the probability of the robot's legs reaching safe footholds. ViTAL integrates both foothold selection and pose adaptation, basing its decisions on \"skills\" that reflect the robot's capabilities and its awareness of the surrounding terrain. The strategy was validated on 90 kg HyQ and 140 kg HyQReal quadruped robots, demonstrating successful traversal of challenging obstacles like stairs, gaps, and rough terrains at varying speeds and gaits.
